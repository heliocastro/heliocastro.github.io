So, my plans was always finish the full KDE1 port, and now on Akademy i have some time to get back to this pet project. Starting on Qt1 porting entirely to CMake because the experience on Qt2 was so good that i decided going back to that and do some of the same love on Qt1.

KDE 1 for that new port next. For now, i'm working on github in my personal repository [Qt1 Github Repo](https://github.com/heliocastro/qt1)

And guess what, on Akademy you can get all possible surprises ðŸ™‚

Thanks to our kdesrc-build hero Michael Pyne, there's **just** Qt 1 running on Windows 10 with WSL.
